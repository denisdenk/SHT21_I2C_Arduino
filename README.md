===================
Description:
-------------

This example includes working with the SHT21 sensor and a display 1602. Once per second, data is read from the sensor and sent to the display and to the UART.

> Note:
 - Using Arduino nano board and SHT21 module with 1602 display (I2c connection via PCF8574)
 - Standart i2c connection using A4 and A5 Arduino Pin
 - Put the necessary libraries in the directory Documents/Arduino
